# ToDo List

A simple todo list I made in vue.js while practicing building a json server. It uses vue router too!

Note: if you are gonna use it you should first change the localhost url from axios fetching.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
